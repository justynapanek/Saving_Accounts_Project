# Saving_Accounts_Project
The comparison between different bank saving plans in Singapore is not straightforward. The return rates depend on customer financial situation, described by several parameter related to customer income and spending behavior like salary or GIRO transactions, as well as the parameters related to insurance, investments and loans (bank products/services).

The objective of this project is to compute and compare the saving account returns from 5 Singapore banks: DBS, OCBC, CitiBank, UOB and MayBank for a defined customer profile (input data from a customer).
